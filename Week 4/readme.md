# Building a CNN-LSTM Model

We are embarking on the development of a [CNN-LSTM model](https://machinelearningmastery.com/cnn-long-short-term-memory-networks/#:~:text=A%20CNN%20LSTM%20can%20be,the%20features%20across%20time%20steps.) aimed at forecasting the stock market prices of [TATA Motors](https://github.com/mohak2003/WIDS-23-24/blob/main/Week%204/TTM.csv). Please thoroughly review the provided [research paper](https://github.com/mohak2003/WIDS-23-24/blob/main/Week%204/CNN_LSTM_RESEARCH_PAPER.pdf) for insights into the optimal configuration of model layers, activation functions, filters, filter sizes, and related parameters. The data preprocessing phase will involve the implementation of the z-score technique, as specified in the paper. It's noteworthy that the dataset we have does not contain any missing values. The primary objective is to predict the adjusted closing price for the following day based on the six features derived from the preceding ten days.
